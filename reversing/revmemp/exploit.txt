'''
DINAMICALLY

If we try to gdb and break in main, we step and it prints "plz don't"

Searching for "plz don't" in ghidra, we find it in the _INIT_1 function, which is executed before the main.

Also "do not play with me!" gives us the other function that prevents debugging

with GHex, patch the binary, removing calls to both functions by replacing them with nops, careful with registers

Then just debug up until the strcmp and see the flag
